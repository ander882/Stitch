#  Old code.  

Pleae note that this is old code and should not be used nor even looked at.  
It is only here for properity.  
It was written to fill a need and no more.

## 3Wde.sh

We need a way to stitch together 3 imanges into one so we could use Propresenter to dislpay 1 image on three screens.

* code to check for all of the images

The images were transfered here from another computer.  
BUT this script started BEFORE all of the images transfered over.
So this will check for how many images there are, wait and then check again.
Do this until no more images have transfered over.

* code to ckeck for nearly all blank images

At the time, we used a blank image except for one white word to notify the end of wanted images.
